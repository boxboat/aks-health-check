[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/boxboat/aks-health-check/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/boxboat/aks-health-check)

This is a client-side tool that uses the Azure CLI and `kubectl` to perform checks against the Azure plane and the Kubernetes plane. These checks are well documented on [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/best-practices).

At BoxBoat, we guide our customers with the use of Kubernetes and surrounding ecosystems. To offer the most value possible to our clients, we created a tool to quickly inspect the configuration of an AKS cluster and it's relevant Azure environment. 

There are many best-practices and some of these are subjective. So, we also have a companion Google Doc template that we use to keep track of results and findings.

📢 [Blog Post](https://boxboat.com/2021/08/04/aks-health-check/)

📄 [The Google Doc AKS Health Check Template](https://bit.ly/boxboat-health-check-report-template-v2) 📄

## Option A - Run with Current User (Preferred 🌟)

``` bash
docker run -it --network host --rm ghcr.io/boxboat/aks-health-check

# Shell in the container
$ az login

$ az account set -s <subscription id>

$ az aks get-credentials -g <resource group> -n <cluster name> --admin

$ kubectl get ns

$ aks-hc check all -g <resource group> -n <cluster name> -i ingress-nginx,kube-node-lease,kube-public,kube-system

$ exit
```

### Optional - Azure Container Registry

If you use Azure Container Registry (ACR), you can have this health check review some basic configuration. If will not inspect container images pushed to the registry. 

To do this, look at the container registries available then specify the `--image-registries` option.

``` bash
$ az acr list --query "[].name"
foo1
foo2

$ aks-hc check all -g <resource group> -n <cluster name> -i ingress-nginx,kube-node-lease,kube-public,kube-system --image-registries "foo1,foo2"
```

## Option B - Run with Azure Service Principal

This option walks you through running the health check using an Azure Managed Identity so that it can be tied to a "service principal". Essentially, it avoids impersoning a user or running with someone's identity.

First, select the Azure subscription.
``` bash
az account set -s <subscription id>
```

Then, set some variables and create a resource group for the container instance.
``` bash
export STORAGE_ACCOUNT="<storage account for logs>"
export FILESHARE_NAME="logs"
export HEALTH_CHECK_RESOURCE_GROUP="<resource group for health check resources>"
export RESOURCE_GROUP="<cluster resource group>"
export LOCATION="eastus"
export MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME="identity-aks-health-check"

az group create -n $HEALTH_CHECK_RESOURCE_GROUP -l $LOCATION
```

Next, create an Azure managed identity so that the Azure container instance can authenticate with Kubernetes.

``` bash

MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=$(az identity create -n $MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME -g $HEALTH_CHECK_RESOURCE_GROUP -l $LOCATION | jq -r '.id')

# for the kubernetes checks
az role assignment create --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role" --assignee $MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID
# for the Azure checks
az role assignment create --role "Reader" --assignee $MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID

```

Then, create a storage account with an Azure file share to place our aks-health-check logs. 

``` bash
az storage account create -n $STORAGE_ACCOUNT -g $HEALTH_CHECK_RESOURCE_GROUP

STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=$(az storage account keys list -n $STORAGE_ACCOUNT -g $HEALTH_CHECK_RESOURCE_GROUP | jq -r ".[0].value")

az storage share create --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT --account-key $HEALTH_CHECK_RESOURCE_GROUP -n $FILESHARE_NAME
```

Finally, we can spin up an Azure container instance running the AKS Health Check.
``` bash
# Set the container admin registry password
read CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD
az container create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP -l eastus -n aks-health-check\
    --image ghcr.io/boxboat/aks-health-check --assign-identity $MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID \
    --command-line "./start-from-aci.sh" \
    -e CLUSTER_NAME=$CLUSTER_NAME RESOURCE_GROUP=$RESOURCE_GROUP OUTPUT_FILE_NAME=/var/logs/akshc/log$(date +%s).txt \
    --restart-policy Never --azure-file-volume-share-name $FILESHARE_NAME \
    --azure-file-volume-account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT --azure-file-volume-account-key $STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY \
    --azure-file-volume-mount-path /var/logs/akshc
```

After some time, the container will spin up and run the health checks. 
The logs will be stored in the Azure file share.

### Clean Up

``` bash
az group delete -g $RESOURCE_GROUP
```

## The Checks

There are about 50+ best-practice recommendations for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). This tool helps the discovery and examination of 22 checks. The rest are either not automated yet, or they will never be since they require more context about the business, a conversation, and ultimately a judgement call.

## Special Thanks 🙏

This project was inspired by the great work of [The AKS Checklist](https://www.the-aks-checklist.com/). Without seeing this, we would have not embarked on this journey.
We were excited because it seemed like a great way to quickly go through MSFT's best practices, then build a report. 
Through practice, we decided to create a Google Doc for the report instead. This allowed us to provide more nuanced answers like "it depends" or "yes, but" or "no, but". 

## Developing

### Requirements

- [Node v12.22.1](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Azure CLI
- `kubectl`

First, `npm install`.

In VS Code, open the command patellete, then select **Debug: Toggle Auto-Attach** so that any new NodeJS application will attach the VS Code debugger.
Select the "Smart" mode.

Then, from the VS Code terminal, invoke the CLI tool by running it against a cluster.

``` bash
az login 
az set -s <subscription id>
az aks get-credentials -n <cluster name> -g <resource group> --admin
npm start -- check azure -g <cluster resource group> -n <cluster name>
```
